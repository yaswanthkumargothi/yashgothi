Marine diversity is very fragile. It need to be monitored regularly to preserve the ecosystems. This application presents the indicators for easy evaluation of marine ecosystems from multiple perspectives i.e., Economy and Environment. The data is from the database from the city of St.Malo, France. This is a demo application built for the presentation purposes.
